# Beyond Bits: Wireless Analog Computing System
This project, named "Beyond Bits" from the inter-hostel tech competition, features a hardware system that functions like an analog calculator. It processes various arithmetic expressions, executing calculations on command using analog components.

## Specifications
- **Input Method**: The arithmetic expression to be evaluated is communicated to the hardware through a wireless IR Module.
- **Supported Operators**: The expression contains four operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and radication (N<sup>th</sup> root), which will be calculated in a calculator style following the BODMAS rule.
- **Operand Range**: The system handles operands in the range 0-12.
- **Analog Components**: The operations are executed using hardware consisting of discrete analog components (Op-Amps, transistors). ADC, DAC, and other ICs are used only for communication purposes.
